# Printf

Project from school 42.

We had to recreate a simpler version of printf.

This project taught me function pointers, and va\_args, which are used to create
functions with a variable number of arguments.

## How to use

Run `make` to build the `libftprintf.a` file which you can then use as you would
printf in a C file.
